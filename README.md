# House_Price_Prediction-_Analysis

In real-world scenarios, house prices are influenced by a combination of factors, and conducting a comprehensive analysis 
is essential to understand the dynamics of a particular market. Additionally, analysis and data visualization can help gain 
deeper insights into the relationships between variables and their impact on house prices.A house price prediction exploratory analysis using pandas 
involves several steps, such as data loading, data cleaning, data visualization,

1. Importing Libraries and Loading Data:
            In this step, import the necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) and load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   
2.Data Overview:
            Use the info() function to get an overview of the dataset, including the data types, non-null counts, and memory usage.

3.Handling Missing Values:
             Replace the Null values using the maximum value for the categorical column and use the average values 
  for the numerical columns.

  4.Data Visualization:
             Using the dataset visualize the data with different graphs and charts for the insights.Here there is different charts used.
             
        * Correlation Heatmap:
                  Generate a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numeric features and identify strong relationships between variables.

        * Bar Plot:
                  A Bar plot to visualize categorical data, such as the number of area-types,availability 

        *lmplot function 
                  In Seaborn, which is used to create scatter plots with linear regression lines and confidence intervals. The lmplot function 
        allows you to quickly visualize the relationship between two numeric variables and fit a linear regression model
        to the data, showing the trend and the associated uncertainty.
